### CREATE ERC20 TOKENS

[Create your own ERC20 tokens on the fly](https://nobodyme.github.io/createERC20tokens/). <br/>

Works by connecting the site to an external wallet like metamask and so does not collect or store your account's private keys in anyway.

One can take a look at the contract we deploy at the file, [ERC20contract.sol](https://github.com/nobodyme/createERC20tokens/blob/master/ERC20contract.sol) in the root folder.
