### CREATE ERC20 TOKENS

A website to create your own ERC20 tokens on the fly.
Works by connecting the site to an external wallet like metamask and so does not collect or store your account's private keys in anyway.
One can take a look at the contract we deploy at the file, ERC20contract.sol in the root folder.
